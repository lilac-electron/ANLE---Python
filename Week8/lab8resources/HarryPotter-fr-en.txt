Mr and Mrs Dursley, who lived at 4 Privet Drive, had always claimed with the greatest pride that they were perfectly normal, thank you for them.
No one would have ever imagined that they could find themselves involved in anything strange or mysterious.
They had no time to waste on nonsense.
Mr Dursley ran Grunnings, a company which manufactured drilling machines.
He was a tall and massive man, who had practically no neck, but did have a good-sized mustache.
Mrs Dursley, on the other hand, was slim and fair and had a neck twice as long as average, which was very useful for spying on her neighbors by peering over garden fences.
The Dursleys had a little boy named Dudley and in their eyes he was the most beautiful child in the world.
The Dursleys had everything they wanted.
The only unwanted thing they had was a secret that they feared more than anything would one day be discovered.
